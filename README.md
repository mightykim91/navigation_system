# Navigation System for Endoscopic Robot

This repository contains python program that has been built for research project "AI-Assited Visual Guidance for Endscopic Robot". This research project was my graduation project at King's College London. 

### Technologies in this program
- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### Technical Background
This program aims to achieve autonomous driving of worm-like Endoscopic Robot developed by Dr.Hongbin Lieu from King's College London. To achieve its aim, I discovered certain feature which is observable very often during endoscopy procedure. This was black hole shape area which is furthermost area from robot's current postion during endoscopy procedure. This feature appeared almost 90% of the time of endoscopy procedure.
